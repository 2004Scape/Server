## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you run into issues please see our [common issues](#common-issues).

1. Download and extract this repo somewhere on your computer
2. Install our [dependencies](#environment-dependencies)
3. Open the folder you downloaded: **Run the quickstart script and follow the on-screen prompts.** You may disregard any severity warnings you see

Once your setup process has completed, wait for it to tell you the world has started before trying to play.

The server includes its own webclient, so you don't have to download a client!

## Dependencies

- [NodeJS 22](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/) - later LTS versions are also fine.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using VS Code (recommended), [we have an extension to install on the marketplace.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2004scape.runescriptlanguage)

## Workflow

Content developers should run `npm start`. The server will watch for changes to scripts and configs, then automatically repack everything.

Engine developers should run `npm run dev`. This does what `npm start` does above, but also completely restarts the server when engine code has changed.

## Common Issues

* `bad option: --import`  
You are using an older version of Node. Reinstall and re-run.

* `'"java"' is not recognized as an internal or external command`  
You do not have Java installed.

* `has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0`  
You are using Java 8 or Java 11. If you have multiple java versions, you are now an "advanced user," go ahead and set `JAVA_PATH=path-to-java.exe` in your .env file.
