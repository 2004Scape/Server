// The fail to find problem and fail to fix cannon are

// Sal's realm and RuneWeb confirm you could still fail to fix the cannon parts in RS2

// The RSC wiki says you stop failing to fix the parts around 74 crafting and 67 smithing.
// The recording of RSC I watched the guy fails each repair twice, and only has a 10 crafting and 30 smithing.
// He failed to find the problem with the cannon 4 times out of 12.
