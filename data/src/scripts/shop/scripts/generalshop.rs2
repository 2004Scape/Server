// In osrs, most generic general shops (shopkeeper w/assistant) use this dialogue, directly opening the shop on the first dialogue option. 
// This is probably an OSRS change as the khazard shop uses the same dialogue as classic (although the khazard shop has different mesanims)
// meaning most generalshops probably call the same label whereas khazard calls a seperate one
