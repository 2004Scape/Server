~chatnpc("<p,neutral>Ranging employs a lot of different weapons as a skill, not just the shortbow you have there. Spears, throwing knives, and crossbows are all used best at a distance from your enemy.");
~chatnpc("<p,neutral>Now, those rats were easy pickings, but on the mainland you will be very lucky if you can find a spot where you can shoot at your enemies without them being able to retaliate.");
~chatnpc("<p,neutral>At close range, rangers often do badly in combat. Your best tactic as a ranger is to hit and run, keeping your foe at a distance.");
