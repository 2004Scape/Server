<b>What is 2004scape?</b><br>

This is an emulation of RuneScape as it was in 2004.<br />
It exists for the sake of nostalgia and preservation of the game's history.<br /><br />

It is not representative of today's RuneScape and does not involve any of their live services.<br />
<b>You <em>cannot</em> play Old School RuneScape here or buy RuneScape gold!</b><br /><br />
