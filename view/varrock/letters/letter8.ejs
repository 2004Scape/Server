<b>Five Ages after creating the world of Runescape, the great god Saradomin now regularly communicates with the inhabitants of this fast evolving planet.

    Dear Saradomin,
<p align=justify>
    When you up-date the new graphics system will  I  be
    able  to  tell what  weapon  I'm using  with out  going
    to the inventory. Because when I'm out in the wild pking
    it's good to  tell a  rune  long from a  rune 2-h, or  a
    hachet from a battle axe.

    Yes, it's  always  nice  to know   what weapon you're
    using  when   you're   mashing   it   into    somebody's
    skull. Just promise me that said  skulls belong to nasty
    Zamorakian   fiends   who   thoroughly    deserve   such
    treatment.  And even then,  I  don't  entirely  approve.
    But  to  answer your question, yes, after the update you
    will indeed be  able to make this visual distinction. So
    you won't feel like some  novice who can't tell his  axe
    from his elbow.

    Can't there  be a  training spot for  ranged attacks?
    Because I can't find a fast spawningpoint for rats.

</i>Such a training spot does exist! But first you  must
    complete the Biohazard  quest- and it's  a biggie. So in
    other words,  you must  work hard  in order  to gain the
    right to train harder. A little puritanical perhaps, but
    there you go.

Dear Saradomin, 
<p align=justify>
    There   have been   some  rumours  going  around  lately
    about  "sleeping  bags,"  and  the  convenience  of  not
    needing to rest on a bed when fatigue is high. Of course
    I do not believe  what  everyone is saying, and  I  just
    wanted to  confirm  that  sleeping bags  do not,in fact,
    exist   in  the   world   of  Runescape.

    I am happy to announce that sleeping bags are indeed the
    stuff of myths. After going to all that trouble to  make
    beds work,  we couldn't  very well just let  you  miners
    crash out  next to the   rocks- that would take us  back
    to square one! And I think it's  nice to walk back  home
    for a well-earned rest.</td><td>

    Dear   Saradomin,   
<p align=justify>
    As  you   know,   the   holidays  are coming up  and  me
    and other    fellow Runescapers  want  to  know what  we
    can expect to happen over the holidays.

    Well, everyone  stop  working  for a few days,  and  the
    population of  turkeys takes  a sharp  nosedive. Is that
    what you meant?  Oh yes, and  people have been  known to
    receive nice gifts, which appear seemingly at random  on
    a certain day of the  year. But only if you're  good, of
    course.<p align=justify>

    Dear  Almighty  One,  
<p align=justify>
    I was  defeating  some black knights far  away
    in the  mountains, and  after a  few  hours I  got
    pretty bashed up. So I went to get cured  by some nice
    Monks who  just  happened  to  be   around the  corner.
    I accidently clicked on one and  started to kill   him.
    I  reduced  him  to very   low health and
    stopped, he   didn't  want  to  continue,   so I
    talked to him, then he said, Yes, I will cure you.   Why
    do   monks  cure   you  after   you  kick   the   living
    daylights out  of them?

    For all my omniscience, I  am somewhat taken aback at  how
    you can  accidentally  start  to  kill   someone. And  I
    imagine  that  the monk was a  little   startled  as
    well. But they  are  a forgiving   bunch, which is   why
    they don't  mind healing  you after  you beat  them  up.
    Just try not to give them a  complete pasting-   they're
    bound to run  out of antiseptic cream eventually.  	
<p align=justify>
    Until next time my friends,
<p align=justify>
    Strength through wisdom,
<p align=justify>
    Saradomin
