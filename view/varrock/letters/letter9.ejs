 <p align=justify>  
    Hail, all ye followers of darkness! Cower in terror,
    all seekers  of light.  Everyone else  can just  listen.
    That self-righteous brother of mine has been hogging the
    stage  for  far  too  long,  especially  when  Runescape
    players know who holds the real power around here- me! 
<p align=justify>
    So I've  stolen Saradomin's  mailbag and  thrown all
    his letters on the floor. I had to pick them up again in
    order to read them, but I think I made my point.
<br>
    Some of them were quite good actually- even if  most
    represented the  sort of  pathetic whining  that I would
    expect from followers of Saradomin. 
  <p><p align=justify>   
    For example:<br>
<i><p align=justify>    
<font color=white> 
<p>
    Dear Saradomin
<p align=justify>    
    Us  Runescape  Veterans  are  so  under-rated.  I've
    been  called  a noob,  yet   I've been  here  since  the
    beginning, and  yet  when  someone asks,   when Runescape
    came out, everyone  insists 2000. Yet  as soon as  I say
    '98, it's  a big laugh. Though in  your newsletter,  you
    stated,   "Five  Ages  after   creating  the   world  of
    Runescape,  the  great  god   Saradomin   now  regularly
    communicates   with    the  inhabitants   of  this  fast
    evolving  planet." Does  that prove that Runescape  came
    out in '98? 
<p align=justify>      
    Wizarding2
</font></i>
<p align=justify>
    Clearly not. And if  you  were truly  a  "veteran", you  
    would  know when Runescape was created. Your friends 
    are right to laugh at you. 
<p align=justify>    
    But at the same time, you were 
    obviously  trying to  intimidate  others with  your  
    pretence of  superior knowledge, and for this you deserve 
    some credit.  
<p align=justify>
    In other letters  and prayers, Toxy55 asks <i> "where
    skeletons come from". </i> My advice would be to head down to
    the wilderness and  find out. As  Guthix would say,  the
    answers are inside of you.
<p align=justify>
    Ah, how I love the wildy. That place where death and
    deceit go  hand in  hand. 
<p align=justify>    
    For  some, this  is a problem. Jacob9ruler complains that 
    <i> "it  is hard to find  someone who doesn't deceive another 
    person in the wilderness, to gain something like an item". 
    </i>
<p>
    <p align=center><img src=/img/newsletter/knight-under-attack.jpg width=285 height=190>  
<font color=white><p align=justify>
    <p><i>"I found that around 35%  of
    the people I 'Team' with actually end up killing me." </i>
<p align=justify>
    This is what I like to hear! So be warned all  naive
    and   foolish   types:   conducting   surveys   on   the
    trustworthiness of your friends can leave you vulnerable
    to attack. 
    But the final word must go to Kenny22, on the subject of
    Christmas hats. 
<p align=justify>    
    <i>"I, personally, woke up at 4am eastern 
    standard time to get the hats." </i> (applause). 
<p align=justify>    
    He then complains about the fact that his friend logged
    on at 12pm and was also able to find hats.</p>
<p align=justify>
    As god of chaos and evil, I naturally assumed that I was 
    the expert at bringing misery into people's lives. But you, 
    Kenny22, show a level of stinginess that surpasses all 
    other Kennys, a meanness of heart that I thought was 
    unattainable in mere mortals.
<p align=justify>    
    Feeling suitably inspired, I must now go and bring some
    more chaos and destruction to the universe. To all 
    those who have been waiting patiently for me, our
    moment is nigh!
<p align=justify>
Strength through chaos-
