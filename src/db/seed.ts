<p>
Magic - 4 new spells have been added which are: Fear, Wind-bolt, Rock-skin, and Elemental-bolt. The bolt spells have also been made much more powerful, and they are no longer dependant on your ranged-combat skill. This means each type of bolt now does a fixed maximum-damage, and to shoot more powerful bolts you need to use high level spells. Finally the staffs have been improved such that if you are wielding a fire-staff, water-staff, air-staff or earth-staff it acts as unlimited runes of that type!
<p>
Player killing - Due to a large number of requests I've changed the way this works. Firstly you can no longer log-out during combat! Closing the webpage or disconnecting your modem will NOT work either! However to compensate I've made it so if you retreat in the game, the person attacking you is stunned for 2 seconds to give you a better chance of getting away. Also when you die you now get to keep your 3 most valuable items! You will still probably lose any ore, food, money, spare weapons, etc... but at least you will no longer lose an item you'd just spent days saving up for! This means if you keep your spare money in the bank you should now be relatively safe.`,

<p>
The "keep 3 best items" rule has also been modified. If you attack another player then you now lose the item-protection for 20 minutes of game time! This makes the player killing aspect of the game more dangerous and exciting, but it also increases your potential reward, as if you kill someone else without item-protection you can now get the best loot! People without item-protection have a small skull drawn above them.

After many requests the guards in Varrock city now attempt to stop people fighting. There are large number of guards at the bank, so assuming they haven't all been killed you can now withdraw your money more safely.`,

Some new locations have been added to the map, there is a new shop in Al-kharid where you can buy plate-mail skirts.

<p>
The trading feature has been improved further. You can no longer accept an offer at the same time as the other player is changing it. This will hopefully stop the cheating and make trading with other players safer.

<p>
I've been working on a new options menu, to allow you to configure the game to your liking. So far there are only 2 options. The 1st option allows you to choose the behaviour of the camera, the new camera mode is the first step in a new system I am developing, which will ultimately make RuneScape run MUCH faster for people with slow computers. The 2nd option is to switch your character between PK and non-PK. (you can only switch twice, so choose carefully). I will be adding more options to the menu as required.

After putting the original improvement online it became apparent that further alterations were necessary so I've ended up making minor alterations repeatedly over the past few days.

<b>The final resulting interface now works as follows:</b>
<p>
Most common actions in the game are now performed using the LEFT mouse button. For instance you can walk around, take objects, open doors, fight monsters, wear armour, etc... All just be left clicking on the item of interest. The new system is much better at working out what you are most likely wanting to do, even when you point at a large number of things at once.
<p>
The RIGHT mouse button now brings up a multiple choice menu, which displays ALL the possible actions that apply to the items you are pointing at. This means even when pointing in a crowded area, or at a large stack of objects you can still use the menu to choose the action you want.
<p>
If you are used to the old interface it may take a bit of getting used to. Just give the new system a chance, and I think you'll prefer it in the long run.
Just remember: left-button=action, right-button=menu
<p>
<b>Advantages of the new system:</b>
<ul>
  <li>You can select items out of large stacks of objects much more easily</li>
  <li>You are less likely to die by accidentally attacking a strong monster</li>
  <li>It is easier to walk around crowded areas of the map</li>
  <li>It is much easier to use crowded locations like furnaces and anvils</li>
  <li>You are much less likely to accidentally drop your pickaxe whilst mining</li>
  <li>No need to remember which button to use. Most actions are now on the left button.</li>
  <li>Dropping items is now easier as you no longer need to click on the ground</li>

<ul>
  <li>Do NOT enter your password into ANY website other than runescape.com! If you go somewhere else and see a chat room or survey or cheat site which claims it needs your password then that site is a trick and will steal your pass. Don't be a fool. Be very suspicious of anything or anyone that asks you for your password.</li>
  <li>Rememeber that real Jagex staff will NEVER EVER ask you for your password! If anyone talks to you, or emails you claiming to be me, and asks for your password, then they are lieing and are trying to steal your account. Jagex staff will NEVER ask you for your password for any reason!</li>
  <li>Be very careful downloading programs from other websites. I have seen programs which claim to give you money, or make you stronger, or cheat in some other way. However this is IMPOSSIBLE! These programs actually contain a VIRUS, which will record your keypresses and steal your password. Get a decent virus checker, and don't run anything not downloaded from an official website.</li>
</ul>
I'm not trying to scare you, all the points above are just common sense! If someone in real-life said "give me your credit card number and I'll credit you £1000!" would you? I sure hope not! Just because runescape is a game doesn't mean you should be any less careful.`,

We're hoping to make it available for just $5 (us-dollars) a month and this tiny amount of money will pay for many great RuneScape updates to come, and will ensure we can keep running RuneScape for YOU.
<p>
This is great news, because it will enable us to offer you more frequent RuneScape updates. Some of the first updates we have planned include: A duelling system, more monsters (wolf, giant-bat, lizard-man etc..), lots of new items, sound effects, more quests, and there will be loads more stuff after this.
<p>
We hope that many people will be able to afford the very small amount we are asking, if you really can't afford to pay then don't worry, because the current FREE RuneScape service will still be available as well! In actual fact running the free service will cost us a lot of money but we want to thank all the people who have helped us beta-test the game so far, and so will keep it going as long as possible.

<p>
As part of our promised commitment to stamping down and stopping cheats in RuneScape we have developed a new system to automatically detect people using macro/bot software to gain stats unfairly.
<p>
It clearly says in our rules that using software to automatically play the game for you and raise your stats for you is cheating!. This will not be tolerated. It is just not fair on the players who play the game honestly and get their levels fairly.
<p>
Our new system is extremely efficient and accurate, and in the last 24 hours we have already identified nearly 2000 players who have been cheating in this way. We also believe that we will be able to identify all future offenders and will continue modifing and improving our detection software to do so. From this point on if you use a macro or use a modified version of the RuneScape client, it is almost 100% certain that you WILL be banned or erased.
<p>
Since these people gained their stats/items unfairly we have unfortunately had no choice but to completely wipe the stats and inventory of the aprox 2000 people who we have caught using macro/bot software. It seems obvious that these players should not be allowed to keep what they did not gain honestly in the first place.
<p>
If you are one of the people who we stat-wiped then whining and making excuses to us won't help. Our new system is designed to have a 0% rate of false positives, and we KNOW you were cheating. The stat-wipe is irreversable, so if you want to get your stats back then the only way to do it is to start playing the game fairly, and EARN your way to greatness like everyone else has to.
<p>
Click here For a complete list of all the people who have already been stat-wiped. We expect to catch more people at it over the next few days. I hope this proves we are deadly serious about stopping this cheating in runescape.`,

<p>
It's been a while since I last revealed what we're currently working on, so here goes!
<p>
Lots of people said it would be really great if RuneScape had more of an overall story-line and if there was some sort of ongoing plot. Therefore we're pleased to say that we've designed a massive twisting plot which we're going to release over multiple episodes. The next update (hopefully tuesday or wednesday), will contain a new quest which is epsiode #1 of this story. We've also been working on a 'RuneScape history' page, which gives some background story for the RuneScape world, which we hope to put online soon.
<p>
Whilst the rest of the dev-team have been focussing on that, myself and Tony have been working very hard on the promised new 3d-graphics system. This is a mammoth task since we are replacing a vast chunk of the graphics and code. The new engine is coming together extremely well, although there's still a lot of work to do. I hope to get another preview online with the next couple of weeks so you can see how we are doing. We're now nearly ready to show a preview demo of our new landscape engine, our new character animation system, and our new improved user interface.
<p>
As I mentioned before this new graphics engine will also allow us much more flexible maps, and so we will finally be able to put the player owned houses and carpentry in. However since that update is still quite a long way off, the rest of the dev-team is going to work on a new 'agility' skill next. This will give the members something else new to enjoy meanwhile whilst we finish off our big graphics update.

Jungle Potion (Members' Quest) Trufitus Shakaya of the Taie Bwo Wannai Village requires that you collect five special jungle herbs for a potion so he can commune with his Gods. The jungle area has been greatly expanded for this quest.

<b>New members town - The town of Yanille:</b>
<p>
Explore this border town in the far south of Kandarin. Experienced Wizards will want to make use of the Wizards' Guild (magic level 66 to enter). Yanille also contains, a bank, a cookery shop, an inn and various other features.
<p>
<b>New members spells - Enfeeble, stun, vulnerability:</b>
<p>
You can now use more powerful high level versions of the the weaken, confuse and curse spells. They are cast using the new "soul rune", bought from the wizards' guild.
<p>
<b>New features:</b>
<p>
Dragon bones - Do you feel like you're praying in vain? Dragon bones can now be buried for a bigger prayer xp bonus than big bones.
<p>
Improved monster A.I. Monsters who are far weaker than you no longer auto attack. We thought it a bit strange that weak monsters were so stupid as to regularly commit suicide on a far stronger opponent, so they won't anymore. This also helps stop cheats who use programs to unfairly keep their character logged in at a respawn point, and gain combat xp unfairly.`,

<p>
Instead of the repetative clicking we have introduced a new 'fatigue' system which means as you do tasks such as mining your character slowly becomes tired. After a certain point (which depends on your level, and on the rock), you will become too tired to mine. When this happens simply rest at a bed or eat some food, and you'll feel much more lively again. The upshot of this is that the honest miners should be able to get their ore slightly quicker, whilst the cheats will just have to go somewhere else.
<p>
Also due to popular request we have modified the wilderness monsters so they are always agressive regardless of your level. It was pointed out by many players that the wilderness is supposed to be dangerous place, so the new monster attacking rule has been removed in this zone.`,

<p>
<ul>
  <li>You can now actually see ore in the rock on the screen, so you can see when it spawns</li>
  <li>Ore now appears in the rocks TWICE as fast as it did pre-fatigue</li>
  <li>When ore is available you will always manage to get it now, you very very rarely miss</li>
  <li>To compensate for the faster spawns you get slightly tired as you mine</li>
  <li>The higher level you have, the more you can mine before you become tired</li>
</ul>
We've put a LOT of effort into balancing this system, I even wrote a little test program to compare the overall times of mining and fishing before and after, (this takes into account the extra time taken to go and get some rest), the time it takes to get ore / level should new be pretty much EXACTLY the same it was before, but mining is now much more varied and fun. We've also moved an awful lots of bed, and a few rocks/fish to make certain all the sites always have a bed within a carefully calculated distance,
<p>
Please give the system a good chance before sending any feedback. We've really put a lot of effort into making sure the version#2 system doesn't disadvantage anyone (except cheats!)
<p>
We might need to make a few more tweaks yet, but hopefully we're getting close to a really good system now.

<ul>
  <li>You can now mine twice as much silver before getting tired. This is because it was pointed out that it shouldn't really by harder to get silver than gold. This actually now means silver is easier to get than it has ever been in the past</li>
  <li>We've made it 2-3 times easier to get gems under the new mining system, since that wasn't quite balanced correctly</li>
  <li>We've added a new mine in the swamp south of Lumbridge with 4 mithril rocks, and 1 adamantite rock, this is to replace the rocks removed from elsewhere. The rocks were moved to make sure everything is the correct distance from a bed for the new system to work properly.</li>
  <li>We made bread, pies, and pizza restore TWICE as much fatigue as they did before, which should make these foods much more worthwhile. We predict enterprising pizza sellers will turn up at the mining sites shortly :-)</li>
</ul>

A few confused players seem to think the new fatigue system actually makes mining take longer, but this is not the case. After testing every single mining site at every single level, we can conclusivly say that it takes no longer to get ore, or level-up than before. But it's a heck of a lot less tedious and repetitive.
<p>
Remember we've added lots of new beds so you might not have to walk as far as you think, we're hoping to add all bed locations to our worldmap soon to help you find them.`,

            content: `Due to popular demand, it is now possible to mine and fish for longer without getting tired!
<p>
There are now two sort of rocks you can mine:
<p>
Soft rocks - These rocks spawn quite slowly, but they are easy to mine so you get very little fatigue from them. Mining these rocks is much like mining was originally before we changed it. You can easily get a full load of ore before you become too tired to mine.
<p>
Hard rocks - These use our new mining system for less repeat clicking. You can get the ore out of the rocks very quickly, and you can see it spawn so you aren't clicking blindly. However you will need to rest quite often when mining these rocks. For people who don't like clicking the same spot on the screen over and over you may find this way more fun.
<p>
We've also adjusted the fishing system. We considered introducing deep and shallow fish, but it doesn't work too well so instead we've just made the fish give a lot less fatigue than before, and spawn close to the original rate. This was what most players indicated they wanted.
<p>
One final note: We are aware that the numbers of soft and hard rocks may need balancing slightly. We will be keeping a close eye on this to make sure there are enough rocks of each type available. Depending on which rock type is most popular we may need to adjust the numbers slightly, so there is no need to ask us about this.`,

<b>Treasure trails</b><br>
Today we have released treasure trails into RuneScape. Various npcs on members servers will now ocassionaly drop random clues.

Each clue points to the location of another random clue. Solve enough clues (and maybe face one or two other challenges) and you will eventually find treasure, which could be anything from food or weapons to various rare items which can only be found on treasure trails.
<p>
Stronger monsters will tend to drop harder clues which will tend to lead towards more valuable treasure. Be warned the hardest clues are very tricky indeed.
<p>
You can&#039;t be on more than one treasure trail at once. If you have a clue, npcs won&#039;t drop more clues until you solve the trail you are on, or you abandon the trail  by dropping your current clue.
<p>
Treasure clue are a fairly rare drop. A similar sort of rarity to low level gems, although not necessarily on the same monsters. If you just keep playing normally you will get them as a pleasant suprise from time to time.
